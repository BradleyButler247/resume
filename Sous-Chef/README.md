Sous Chef
Link - **Heroku won't allow me to push**

Sous Chef is meant to assist users with finding recipes to cook. They will be able to find recipes simply by browsing random recipes from the Spoonacular API, searching for specific recipes by name and even searching for recipes that use the ingredients they have at home. Once users find a recipe they are able to "order" ingredients (orders don't actually go anywhere because instacart/doordash wouldn't let me use their API). Users are also able to find substitutes to ingredients but searching the ingredient they want to replace. They can also leave reviews on recipes and favorite recipes they liked.

The site uses HTML, Javascript, CSS and Python.
